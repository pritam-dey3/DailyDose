# DailyDose

> **A notification scheduler for your daily non-urgent reminders.**

DailyDose is a lightweight, set-it-and-forget-it application designed to send you daily reminders. It adds flexibility to your routine by allowing you to assign a **frequency** (e.g., "once a week", "twice a month") to each message. Not every reminder needs to be seen every day—DailyDose helps you surface what matters, when it matters, keeping your notifications fresh and less intrusive.

## Features

- **Frequency-Based Scheduling**:
  - **Soft Rhythm**: Assign urgency multipliers to interests (Demand). Items naturally float to the top over time based on how long it's been since you last saw them, ensuring a varied mix of content without rigid scheduling.
  - **Hard Quotas**: Need to study a topic "3 times a week"? Set a specific quota, and the system guarantees it fits into your weekly cycle, prioritizing these items as the deadline approaches.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Configure your digests to run at whatever times suit you best.
